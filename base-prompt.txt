This is a project wih the goal to segment text line images from historical manuscripts. As historical manuscripts have curved text lines, footnates, notes and diverse layouts this is a difficult problem.
In this code, we treat each character on the manuscript page as a 2D point, with the goal to connect all characters (points) of a same line together.
In other words, each character must have atmost two connections (edges) - one to the previous character in the line, and one to the next character in the line.
We also assume that these two connections have to be in opposite directions (We select pairs with angles close to 180 degrees) 
Finally we cluster using DBSCAN to remove outliers.
