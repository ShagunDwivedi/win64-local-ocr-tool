The follow is the code of a .vue annotation tool which does the following:
This Annotation tool is used for annotating the layout of Historical Manuscripts, which handwritten, curvy line, messy footnotes etc. 
To do this, an upstream application already marks each character present on the manusscript page as a node, and connects each node (character) to it's previous and next characters.
Hence for each page the code loads a graph, with nodes representing a character, and edges connecting a character to it's previous and next characters.
Ideally all nodes of a text-line have to be connected together with edges. 
But sometimes the upstream algorith makes mistakes, requiring us to annotate - by adding or deleting edges.
Once annotation is done, we can save the updated_graph.
The tool also has other downstream applications such as Annnotate text.

Primarily right now, I want your help in improving the User Experience (UX) of addition and deletion of edges. PLease make the following changes
 - when I press and hold 'd' all edges I HOVER over get deleted
 - When I press and hold 'a' , all the nodes I HOVER over, get connected with edges using a Minimum Spanning Tree
 - Have a threshold, such that I won't need to HOVER exactly over the nodes to join, it's okay if I just hover near them (but still close)
 This make require making extensive changes to the code. Please make them, but make sure all other functions apart from the UX remain the same.
 I should be able to use the new code a drop in replacement.
 - minor change: also all me to save the graph, even if I have not made any modifications. 
 - replace buttons:  Show Points, Show Graph, Edit Mode! with only Edit Mode (we can show graph and points when Edit Mode is on). Edit Mode will be ON by default.
